# Proactive Review

TODO: Answer all of the following questions in the specified fashion. Please
note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository has a passing
build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have adequately answered
all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to each of them.

TODO: Please note that you are invited to provide responses to all of these
questions as a part of your class participation grade in this course. It is
important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory answers to all of
these questions you will not earn a checkmark grade for this review project.

## Technical Review

### Record three Python functions from the following sources that you can correctly write on your own without assistance

You can review the following materials for examples of Python functions:

- course textbooks
- course web site
- course slides
- any course projects, including:
    - source code surveys
    - programming projects
    - engineering efforts

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to record these Python functions
TODO: The fenced code block must designate that it contains Python source code
TODO: Please do not pick the same fenced code blocks that you did for the last review
TODO: The fenced code blocks that you provide should be from content covered during this module

#### Provide a Python function that you can write on your own without assistance from a prior examination

#### Provide a Python function that you can write on your own from content covered since the last examination

#### Provide a Python function that you cannot write on your own and explain why that is the case

### Using a previously provided function, modify it to illustrate a defect and then explain why it is wrong

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to provide the example of a defect in a Python function
TODO: You must provide at least one paragraph to explain why the source code is defective
TODO: Your response should explain a mental model that would lead to a programmer making this mistake

### Using the defective function, provide a function call example that would show it is wrong

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to provide a call to the defective Python function
TODO: You may express this function call example through either a "main function" or a test case

## Learning Objectives

TODO: Review the learning objectives at [Learning Objectives for Data
Abstraction
structures](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/data-abstraction/learning-objectives-data-abstraction/)
and then use the following instructions to complete the next questions.

TODO: The learning objectives that you state and discuss should be different than the ones
that you explained during the completion of the last two proactive review assignments

### Record three learning objectives for which you judge you can demonstrate mastery of the technical knowledge or skill

#### Restate the first learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

#### Restate the second learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

#### Restate the third learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

### Give a learning objective that you have improved on since the last module of the course

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain what you did to improve your knowledge
TODO: When you are writing your response to this question, please follow this template:

When I was working on `fill in the name of a project`, I made a mistake when I
`explain details about the mistake`. I did not understand `explain what you did
not understand`. Now I know `explain what you know`. I revealed the gap in my
understanding by `explain what steps you took to identify the gap`. Now I know
`explain what you now know`. To demonstrate my improved understanding, I will
`explain what steps you will take now that you understand the learning
objective`.

### Give a learning objective that connects to covered material but for which you must continue to work

TODO: Retype the learning objective and the explain what work you need to
complete so as to ensure that you can develop a mastery of the stated technical skill

TODO: Provide a direct link to the segment that describes the learning objective in the
course web site so that it is clear you have correctly described it in your own writing

## Review Checklist

TODO: Please create a filled checkbox for each review task that you completed:

- [] Re-read all of the content in the covered chapters of the course textbooks
- [] Studied and executed all of the Python source code in the Jupyter notebooks
- [] Correctly answered all of the summary questions in the Jupyter notebooks
- [] Reviewed and understood all of the technical content in the course slides
- [] Completed all source code surveys, programming projects, and engineering efforts
- [] Confirmed that you have a passing build in all of the aforementioned projects
- [] Reviewed any available instructor feedback in each of the aforementioned projects
- [] Answered all of the questions in the proactive review document

TODO: If you have questions or concerns about content in this module that you
could not resolve after completing the proactive review, you should take these steps:

- [] Post questions to a public channel in Discord for any unresolved issues
- [] Schedule office hours with the course instructor to discuss any unresolved issues

## Professional Evaluation

TODO: Please note that your responses to these questions will neither positively
or negatively influence your grade in this course. You should answer these
questions honestly so that the course instructor and the technical leaders can
best ensure that they are delivering and will continue to deliver appropriate
instruction in computer science.

## Professional Reflection and Action

### Assuming that the Department of Computer Science had unlimited resources and that the course instructor had unlimited time, what is one way to improve the course that would at least double your overall ability to learn computer science?

TODO: Please answer this question with at least one paragraph consisting of at least three sentences

### Bearing in mind that resources and time are inherently limited, customize your answer to the previous question so that it can be feasibly implemented for the upcoming academic semester

TODO: Please answer this question with at least one paragraph consisting of at least three sentences

### Find at least one way to improve the Proactive Programmers web site and report it through the issue tracker

TODO: Please refer to the following web site when you are looking for improvements:
https://proactiveprogrammers.com/

TODO: You may find a link to the issue tracker at the bottom of every page on
the Proactive Programmers web site. For your reference, here is the direct link
to the GitHub issue tracker for the web site:
https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/issues

TODO: Note as part of your completion of this question you need to create a new
issue in the issue tracker for the Proactive Programmers web site. The course
instructor will take into account all suggestions during and, as appropriate,
make changes to the site in preparation for the upcoming semester.

TODO: Make sure that you include a reference (as a URL) to the issue in the
issue tracker that you created as a part of your response to this question.
